# Chess-Grid Project - Started April 18

### Goal
The goal of this project was to build a chess board that can change colors depending on the option selected. It was also done to practice using css grid and javascript.

### Thoughts
A very enjoyable project to build. Would be inclined to return to this project later and make playing an entire chess game possible!
